/* Recommended ESC & settings

*****************************************************************************
  ESC: HOBBYWING 1080 QUICRUN WP Crawler Brushed with the following settings:
  Vehicle: TAMIYA trucks with 3 speed transmission
  Motor: 540 size, 35 turns, stock pinion

  For more details refer to the ESC manual.
  Uncommented settings are left on factory preset
  1: 3
  2: 1 (1=  LiPo, 2 = NIMH battery)
  3: 3
  4: 3
  5: 4
  6: 2
  7: 9
  8: 1
  9: 8 (change it, important)
  10: 4
  11: 4
  12: 5
  13: 5 (16KHz = less whining)
  14: 1 (be careful here, this will change the BEC voltage!!)
  15: 1 (change it, important)

*****************************************************************************
  ESC: HOBBYWING QUICRUN FUSION motor / ESC combo with the following settings:
  Vehicle: RGT EX86100 Jeep Crawler, stock pinion, 3S LiPo
  Motor: Integrated brushless

  Make sure you are uncommenting (remove //) "#define QUICRUN_FUSION" below!

  For more details refer to the ESC manual.
  Uncommented settings are left on factory preset
  1: 2 (change it, 1 is jerky)
  2: 1
  3: 3
  4: 1
  5: 2 (change it, if Vehicle is driving in wrong direction)
  6: 1 (be careful here, this will change the BEC voltage!!)
  7: 5
  8: 1
  9: 4 (change reverse speed as you prefer)

*****************************************************************************
  HOBBYWING 1060 is working as well, but 1080 is still better

*****************************************************************************
  AS-12/6RW EASY from Modellbau-Regler.de is suitable for smaller vehicles (WPL, MN Model etc.),
  but does not have the best drag brake. Better use an RZ7886 motor driver IC (see below)

  Pin 1 to 33 "ESC"
  Pin 2 to 32
  Pin 3 to GND (0V)
  Pin 4 to Battery +
  Pin 5 & 6 to motor +
  Pin 7 & 8 to motor -
  Notes:
  - Make sure to have enough copper area around motor + and - for IC heatsinking!
