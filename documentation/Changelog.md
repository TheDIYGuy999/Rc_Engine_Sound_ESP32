- Trailer coupling & uncoupling sounds in preparation, not yet working

### 6.4:
- CH1 & CH2 input pins can be used as PWM output for the steering servo and for the shifting servo. The outputs are active, if a BUS communication mode (SBUS, IBUS or PPM) is selected. This allows to use vers small "BUS-only" receivers. In this case, the servos are connected to the sound controller instead.
- Additional Servo adjustments parameters in tab "7-adjustmentsServo.h" added:
   - "SERVO_FREQUENCY" 50Hz is standard, some servos run smoother @ 100Hz.
   - Servo limits: left, center, right (allows to adjust both end points as well as the center point separately

- Added the missing "shifting" file type & german dropdown translations in "Audio2Header.html"
- Bug in Mack Super Liner configuration fixed
- IBUS interface tested, works fine, but "MAX_RPM_PERCENTAGE" > 350 will crash the ESP32. I recommend to use SBUS instead, because current Flysky firmware can generate SBUS signals as well.
- "MAX_RPM_PERCENTAGE" automatically limited according to communication mode. Required to prevent the controller from crashing (see above)
- In PWM mode, we can now read 6 channels
- PPM interface moved to RX pin, pins "35" & "PPM" are now used for PWM channels 5 & 6
- Bug fixed: wasteghate not triggered anymore while releasing brake rapidly

- CAT 3408 Peterbilt added

### 5.0:
- The already existing "REV_SOUND" option is now fading over between the idle sound and the resound. This provides a very realistic behavior for heavy truck engines. Example see "Cat3408Settings", "Messerschmitt Bf109", "Unimog U1000". The fading threshold can be adjusted with the "revSwitchPoint" variable
- Optimized throttle fader for more realistic sound while gear shifting
- Optimised Wastegate triggering
- Optimised and new sound examples: Unimog U 1000 Turbo, Caterpillar 3408 (for King Hauler)

- Ignition knock sound is now triggered by the optional revving sound as well
- Sounds and configuration example for Messerschmitt Bf 109 added (first example, which uses resound)

### 4.82:
- Missing .h files for the Ural 2 setting added
- Once again thanks to MAN Tgx for pointing out this issue

### 4.81:
- Bugfix: Several file names contained "Scanıa" (with Turkish i) instead of "Scania". This appears to be a problem under Windows but works fine under macOS
- Example configurations and .h files were reworked accordingly
- Thanks to MAN Tgx on the German RC Modellbau Portal for reporting this bug: https://www.rc-modellbau-portal.de/index.php?threads/esp32-arduino-rc-sound-und-licht-controller.7183/page-14#post-229253

### 4.8:
- Throttle fader for more natural knock behavior during take off
- Improved wiring and adjustments instructions down below
- New insanely loud supercharger sound option
- Example see "JeepCherokeeTrackhawkSettings" (use 6 gears in "curves.h)

### 4.7:
- Experimental support for my new rcTrigger library added
- Allows to trigger multiple latching and non latching actions per analog channel
- Note, that you have to install this library: https://github.com/TheDIYGuy999/rcTrigger

### 4.6:
- 75mm tank cannon fire sound and flash added
- Triggered via CH4
- Flash is using "Beacon 1" output
- Example settings: CATERPILLAR_MODE

### 4.5:
- CATERPILLAR_MODE (dual throttle input on CH2 & CH3 for tanks, diggers, bulldozers etc.
- No ESC control support in this mode! Wire two crawler type ESC (with direct brake) in partallel with CH2 & CH3 inputs, use dual headers)
- Example settings: CATERPILLAR_MODE_Settings (copy and paste it in "Adjustments.h")
- Also working in SBUS mode (allows to use additional sounds)
- New V12 tank sound from JPS952

### 4.4:
- Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk added. Speaker with good bass reproduction needed!
- DAF XF truck added
- Adaptive knock volume added (the first knock per engine cycle will be louder, if defined "ADAPTIVE_KNOCK_VOLUME", adjust volume for others with "dieselKnockAdaptiveVolumePercentage" (see DAF XF settings)
- "Settings" files cleaned up

### 4.3:
- Simulated sequential double clutch transmission added. Variable "doubleClutch" in "Adjustments.h". See Ferrari setting (use 6 gears in "curves.h")
- Automatic transmission shifting strategy is now more robust, no oscillation anymore. See Chevy Nova V8 setting (use 3 gears in "curves.h")
- Knock sound for Chevy Nova V8 added. Sounds just great in combination with the 3 speed automatic transmission!

### 4.2:
- Dynamic, adaptive shift points for automatic transmission, depending on engine load allows economic driving
- Kick down detection will shift back, if instant full throttle is applied
- Replaced "sawtooth" arrays for automatic gear ratios with three one dimensional arrays for 3, 4 or 6 gears
- Reverse detection, only one gear in this case
- Gear ratios according to Allison datasheet (adjust reverse gear ratio according to your ESC reverse top speed)
- PROTOTYPE_36-PIN renamed to PROTOTYPE_36 to prevent compiler warnings
- Settings profiles for Ferrari & trophy truck with 6 speed automatic transmission & Chevy Nova with 3 speed automatic transmission added

### 4.12:
- Further automatic transmission fine tuning after big test drive with the Actros

### 4.11:
- Automatic transmission optimised in 1/14 scale Actros truck with Hobbywing 1080 ESC

### 4.1:
- Inspired by Wombii's fork of this repo: optimised simulated automatic transmission: load dependent "torque converter slip" added, optimised "4 speed sawtooth array", which is simulating the shifting points. Now we have 4 gears instead of 3, but you still can uncomment the 3 speed version array and use it instead. I recommend to use "automatic = true" in "Adjustments.h", if your RC vehicle does not have a real shifting transmission. My solution is way more simplistic than Wombii's, but still sounding good. Example settings see Land Rover and fire truck
- Harley Davidson optimised

### 4.0:
- Failsafe for SBUS now implemented and tested in the King Hauler build. The vehicle will do a controlled stop, if the SBUS wire is disconnected
- The SBUS failsafe flag from the receiver should in theory do the same, but I was not yet able to test it

### 3.9:
- Initial SBUS support on pin 36 "VP". Tested in combination with my "Micro RC" receiver (SW v3.4). Only one single signal wire required!
- It's working fine, but failsafe is not yet ready. Use it at your own risk!
- Use variables "SBUS_COMMUNICATION" & "sbusInverted" (changing signal polarity without an additional transistor) in "Adjustments.h" for configuration
- if you want to change the channel assignment, do it in readSbusCommands()
- Throttle overflow bug solved
- New, optimized Detroit Diesel mix for the KingHauler see "KingHaulerSettings2"

### 3.8:
- Experimental support for automatic transmission simulation. Use "automatic = true" to activate it
- Eagle schematic now including .brd PCB file -> upload it on www.oshpark.com to order your boards easily

### 3.7:
- "PROTOTYPE_36-PIN" allows switching headlights pin between D0 & TX0 pin. Required for the change to a 30 pin ESP32 board, which will be used on the final PCB.
- On the final PCB, the ESP32 will be powered from the ESC, the amplifier, the shaker and the LED from the on board 5regulator. This requires to remove the popping noise, which is generated, when the DAC offset of 128 is activated. So I added a fader for the DAC offset.

### 3.61:
- Tatra 813 V12 8x8 sound optimised
- New cooling fan & knock sounds

### 3.4:
- Experimental support for separate engine revving sound. See "REV_SOUND" in Adjustments.h (don't use it)
- New Diesel ignition "knock" sound (fixed sample rate), played in synch with the engine sound (variable sample rate). This results in a way more realistic Diesel sound, because the ignition "knock" does not vary in pitch.
- engine sound is now mixed together from up to 4 sounds: idle, turbo, wastegate, Diesel knock. All of them are variable in volume, depending on throttle position or engine RPM. You can adjust everything, using a lot of variables in "Adjustments,h". The result is a very realistic engine sound. Allows to use an engine RPM range of 3 instead of 2 without sounding strange
- New squeaky brake sound
- Up to 11 sounds are now played in parallel!

### 3.3:
- Dimmed headlights during engine start
- International DT-466 sounds added

- A speaker with good bass reproduction is required!

### 3.0:
- Ramping ESC signal faster below "clutchEngagingPoint" to prevent clutch from excessive slipping
- Solved a 2nd engine rpm bug during braking

### 2.91:
- Engine sound was slowing down too much during braking. This bug is now solved
- No turbo sound while braking: Bug solved
- King Hauler parameters fine adjusted
- "clutchClosingPoint" renamed to "clutchEngagingPoint"

### 2.9:
- "shiftingAutoThrottle" is altering throttle for synchronizing while shifting the TAMIYA 3 speed transmission -> Gearbox is protected, extreme realism in engine sound!
- More inertia added, engine idle volume lowered to 40%

### 2.8:
- "clutchClosingPoint" configuration variable added. Prevents engine sound from "rubber band effect". Engine sound is in synch (clutch engaged) with ESC power above this value
- Virtual clutch is also disengaging during gear shifting, allowing the engine rpm to settle down during shifting
- Acceleration speed now variable, depending on throttle position
- Added way more inertia to make vehicle behavior even more realistic
- Brake has now much finer granularity

### 2.7:
- Hornblasters train horns added
- Horns are now louder
- Trash removed
- Acceleratoin & deceleration now shifting transmission gear dependent

### 2.6:
- Indicator activation point adjustable with "indicatorOn"

### 2.5:
- 3rd brake light on pin 32 added
- "escPulseSpan" > 1400 now working properly. Allows to accelerate and decelerate even smoother as well as limiting the top speed to a realistic level

### 2.4:
- Bug fixed: direct transition from state "braking backwards" to "driving backwards" now working
- failsafe function for serial signal added. Emergency brake is triggered in case of RC signal loss (serial & PWM mode only, PPM will follow)

### 2.3:
- Reversing light, reversing beep and brake light behaviour changed in order to interact correctly with the new vehicle mass simulation
- ESC is locked, if engine is not running ;-)
- Air brake sound now triggered correctly, as soon as the brake pedal is released
- I'm really amazed about this update! The vecihle almost behaves like a real truck now.

### 2.2:
- Support for crawler ESC (with direct brake) on pin 33. Vehicle mass simulation with proportional brake! Tested in Tamiya King Hauler (REELY Model No H0050 ESC) and working fine, but use it at your own risk! If you want to test it, connect ESC to pin 33 of the ESP32 instead of the receiver output.
- LED pins rearranged  to fit my board layout (you can change it in the pin assignment section)
- Scania R620 sound added

### 2.1:
- Additional turbo sound (playing in parallel with engine sound), volume and throttle dependent volume adjustable

- Added more horns
- Added indicator (blinker) ticking sound
- Added independent volume adjustment for every sound
- Engine sound volume is now throttle dependent (adjustable)

### 1.7:
- Added shaker motor control on pin 23. Simulates engine vibration. IRLZ44N Mosfet and freewheel diode 1N5819 required
- Shaker power can be adjusted with the variables "shakerMin" & "shakerMax" in Adjustments.h
- Driver schematic down below
- I'm using a shaker motor from the G.T.Power kit 103061 (this controller is crap, but the accessories are useful)
- Foglight and side light pins moved to pins 18 & 19

### 1.6:
- Servo input channels rearranged to match the pinout of the "Micro RC" receiver (you can change it in the pin assignment section)

### 0.7:
- fixed auto throttle zero calibration bug
- fixed "gap" bug, if sounds were triggered in PWM mode
- PWM mode now allows to trigger 2 sounds

### 0.6:

### 0.5:
- added idle sound volume adjustment variable "idleVolumePercentage" in "Adjustments.h"
- added Union Pacific 2002 SD70M 16 cylinder Diesel locomotive sounds
- added Jaguar XJS HE car sound (bad quality)

### 0.1:
- Runs on an ESP32 (240MHz)
- It's still quick and dirty, but works with the included V8 short course truck idle sound
- sounds way better than the ATmega 328 version, thanks to  22'050Hz sampling rate (instead of 8'000Hz)
